# Card Recognizer

**Card Recognizer** is a computer vision and deep learning project that identifies playing cards from a live camera feed or pre-captured images. It uses Python, OpenCV, and a neural network (TensorFlow or PyTorch) to classify each card by its rank and suit. The goal is to start with one specific deck and then generalize the model to recognize multiple different decks.

## Project Overview

The Card Recognizer project aims to detect and classify playing cards in real-time using a camera or static images. It can identify the card’s rank (Ace, 2–10, Jack, Queen, King) and suit (Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades). Over time, the model will be trained on various card designs, allowing it to recognize cards from multiple decks.

---

## Features

- **Single-Card Classification**: Identifies cards when only one card is shown to the camera.  
- **Neural Network Backbone**: Uses deep learning (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) for robust classification.  
- **OpenCV Integration**: Detects and isolates the card region from raw images/video streams.  
- **Extendable to Multiple Decks**: Once trained on one deck, you can add more datasets to improve model generalization.  
- **Real-Time Inference**: Displays the recognized card in real-time (e.g., via webcam feed).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.7+  
- **pip** or **conda** for managing packages  
- **OpenCV** for image and video processing  
- **TensorFlow** (or **PyTorch**) for training and inference  
- **Labeling Tool** (optional, if using object detection): [LabelImg](https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg), [CVAT](https://github.com/opencv/cvat), or [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)  
- **VSCode** (or any other IDE/text editor)

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CardRecognizer.git
   cd CardRecognizer
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. **Install required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   The `requirements.txt` might include packages like:
   - opencv-python
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - tensorflow (or torch, depending on your chosen framework)

## Data Collection & Preparation

1. **Capture images** of each card in your deck under different angles and lighting conditions.  
2. **Organize your images**:
   ```
   data/
       train/
           2_of_hearts/
           3_of_hearts/
           ...
       test/
           ...
   ```  
   (Alternatively, if you use object detection, annotate bounding boxes for each card in tools like LabelImg or CVAT.)

3. **Preprocessing** (optional but recommended):  
   - Use OpenCV to detect card contours and crop/warp them to a frontal view.  
   - Apply any data augmentation you need (rotations, brightness changes, etc.) for more robust training.

---

## Training Process

1. **Set up the model**: Choose a classification model (e.g., a fine-tuned MobileNet or ResNet if using TensorFlow) or an object detection model (YOLO, SSD) if you want multi-card detection.  
2. **Run the training script**:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
   - This script should load your training dataset, build/compile the model, and run the training loop.  
   - Monitor training and validation accuracy/loss.  

3. **Evaluate the model** on the test dataset to confirm performance.

4. **Export/Save your model**:
   - TensorFlow example:
     ```python
     model.save("card_classifier.h5")
     ```
   - PyTorch example:
     ```python
     torch.save(model.state_dict(), "card_classifier.pth")
     ```

## Usage

1. **Real-Time Inference on Desktop**:
   ```bash
   python test_realtime.py
   ```
   - Opens your webcam and tries to detect and classify the card in view.  
   - Displays the predicted card rank/suit in a window.  

2. **Inference on Static Images**:
   ```bash
   python classify_image.py --image path/to/card_image.jpg
   ```
   - Loads a single image, detects/crops the card, and prints the predicted class.

3. **Mobile App Integration** (optional):
   - Convert your trained model to **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX**.  
   - Integrate it into your Android/iOS app to perform local inference on device.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Multi-Card Detection**: Use an object detection approach (e.g., YOLO) to detect multiple cards simultaneously.  
- **Multi-Deck Dataset**: Expand the image dataset to include various deck designs, ensuring better generalization.  
- **Augmented Reality Overlays**: Display the recognized card’s name or additional information as an overlay in real time.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Quantize or prune the model to reduce inference time on mobile devices.
